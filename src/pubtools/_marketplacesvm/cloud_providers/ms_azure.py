    Borg to keep track of the Azure destinations which were changed.

    Since we don't want to touch an offer which its original state is "draft" we need to keep
    track of the visited offers to mark them as "safe".

    This is required because whenever we touch a single plan to assign the VM image we're also
    changing the offer status to "draft". Supposing the existence of "Offer-A", which has 2 or more
    plans, whenever we change the first plan the offer state would be "draft" thus leaving it
    impossible for the program to know, when adjusting the second offer, whether the "draft" state
    comes from a change in the offer before we touch the first plan or not.

    In order to solve this issue we check the offer before changing anything and mark it in the
    Borg as "visited" to have a clear state of what "draft" may represent.
