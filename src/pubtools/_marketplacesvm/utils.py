class BuildIdBorg:
    """
    Borg to keep track of single builds with multiple push items.

    Its main goal is to allow tracking when a task was skipped or not for a given
    build which may contain multiple push items for different locations and the mappings are not
    meant for all of them.

    It contains two sets:

    - received_builds: Meant to store the builds from push items received directly from pushsource.
    - processed_builds: Meant to store the builds which were successfully pushed.
